# ADM-HW1

This repository contains the required material for the first Homework of ADM. In particular it contains: 

1. A README.md file, which explains the content of the repository;

2. A scripts.py file. This file contains the scripts of all the successful exercises, each one of them is preceded by its title. 

3. A stamps.pdf pdf file. This file contains the screenshots of the submissions of the different exercises and challeges, taken from my Hackerrank account. 
   On the first page of this pdf there is an incorrect submission that I didn't manage to fix ye.
